  <p>Today I’m wearing these (Michael) shoes from Paraboot, a Gitman Brothers Vintage rounded club collar shirt that I scored at a sample sale back in 2015 that I don't wear all that much, I don't usually wear very strong colours, and my dad's old Burberry trench from the eighties.  </p>

  <p>I decided to go through my parents' closet out on a whim while I was back for the holidays, and found this trench which looked completely pristine as if it had never really been worn before. When I asked my dad about it, he'd mentioned that it was a gift from either his younger sister or his mum. He never felt very comfortable about thinking that much about his clothing, and found the coat a bit too flashy for his taste. So they kind of just sat in the wardrobe and; it would’ve been a shame just to literally just let them sit there, so I took it back with me to New York.</p>
