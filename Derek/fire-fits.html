  <p>If I had to save something in my wardrobe from a fire….my mind immediately jumps to it has to be something that's irreplaceable. So for me, it would be my De Bonne Facture coat which I first saw on Instagram. I could not get this damn coat out of my mind for the whole week, and that was a really big problem because I had exams and I could not sit down and focus on studying.</p>

  <p>I spent two hours looking up the stockist of this brand, eventually finding one out in Brooklyn. I saw this coat originally in a different fabric and in a different colour, liked this version even more and then dropped about 80 to 90% of one month's rent on that. Was it a sound decision? Financially speaking, absolutely not. Do I regret having done that? Absolutely not because I anticipate keeping this coat for 20, 30 years or something like that, because it just will never go out of style.</p>

  <p>I’m not exaggerating when I say there are many times in the middle of summer.I would just throw it on for a bit while I’m just inside the apartment, even though it’s absolutely not the weather to be wearing it.</p>
