  <p>Iâ€™m still figuring out my personal style. I think I will figure that out for the rest of my life, because it's definitely something that will continue to change because as you keep growing. My preference is definitely a little bit more, uh, sparked and a little bit more buttoned up; I would say that my background has definitely influenced a lot of it.</p>

  <p>I attended an elementary school in a very British style preparatory school setting, which definitely contributed to defining my personal style, and I also have definitely a lot of classic tailoring kind of influence in. My style influences come from, like modern fashion, I would say not necessarily runway or designer, but more so from Japanese street wear, Popeye, for example, the whole city boy look has been a really big inspiration recently. I also got a lot of inspiration from people I see on the street, a lot of inspiration from womenswear. One of my inspirations is women wearing menswear better than men ever did.</p>

  <p>I think I would say the final component of my personal style is that balance of both. So it's nice to have one item offsetting the other item.</p>
