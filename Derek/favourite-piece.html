    <p>My favourite piece in my wardrobe actually might be this Lemaire Coat. I don't wear it super often because the fabric is relatively spongy, which it doesn't do amazingly when it's super windy.</p>

    <p>I really like it because it's a really simple design, it has two buttons in front, and the pockets have an interesting shape. They have this like cutout to them, shaped a bit like a pentagon which is cool because it's a centre entry which is a really interesting detail cause you can put your hand in from any direction, and it captures a very particular of being simple and elegant, but full of little tiny surprises.</p>

    <p>I would say that is my favourite piece right now. I don't wear it all the time, but when I do, it's always a joy. I think outerwear is my favourite category of clothing.</p>
