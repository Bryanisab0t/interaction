  <p>My oldest in my wardrobe that gets regular use. It's this brown leather jacket. Basically I got accepted into NYU, and he was very proud of that. And so one weekend, he's just driving me around in his car, and suddenly he pulls into a leather goods store called Danier. I've known about this place for a little bit because my cousin worked there very briefly as a teenager.</p>

  <p>I was like, “What are we doing here?”</p>

  <p>And he was like, “Oh, you're going to New York. So you're going to need a leather jacket.”</p>

  <p>So we went in and I found one that I kind of like, and he gave his approval and then he walked down and he bought it. It was  very strange because this is the first time that my dad has ever willingly bought a physical thing for me. Is it the highest quality of leather? Probably not. But I've worn it pretty consistently from 2014 till now in 2022. It's got a little bit more beat up and the leather is definitely worn in a little bit, even though it was pretty, you know, it's not like I needed that much breaking in, in the beginning, it's a staple in my wardrobe.</p>

   <p>My dad never really approved of me liking clothes, but it was his way of trying to connect with my interests.</p>
