  <h4 class="moveup10">Masculinity in Fashion</h4>
  <p>Me being a guy who is cis-gendered and straight, but at the same time, Like, I'm not the most manly of men. I am not rippling with muscles nor do I have the manliest of beards, but at the same time, like, you know, being capable of. Appreciating both masculinity and femininity like silk scarves, silk scarves are great. They're really good for balancing out like the military, like a trench coat and a smooth sensuality that a silk scarf can have, and it's nice to be able to balance everything.</p>

  <p>Wearing a silk scarf because I don't think it detracts anything from who I am. And I'm also okay with my own physique as well. Like, should I head to the gym a little bit more? You know, like probably I can get a little bit more definition. Sure. But I also know that, like, I find it difficult to put on a few pounds. I think that the idea of masculinity is that I don't feel the need to change, accepting my body for what it is and emphasising those parts I like.</p>
